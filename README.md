# Track-Track

## Overview

Track-Track is a solution to capture your entire music library in one place, regardless of the streaming source. The intention of Track-Track is not to play music, but rather to keep track of the music library of a user in an interactive database free of what music services they are currently subscribed to. Additionally, Track-Track aims to capture memories as users add music to their library, keeping track of where the user originally discovered a song.
